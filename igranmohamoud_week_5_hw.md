**Question 1**

***SCRUM CEREMONIES***

**Product backlog refinement** - Sometimes called product backlog grooming in reference to keeping the backlog clean and 
orderlyâ€”is a meeting that is held near the end of one sprint to ensure the backlog is ready for the next sprint.

**Sprint planning** - The purpose of sprint planning is to define what can be delivered in the sprint and how that work 
will be achieved. Sprint planning is done in collaboration with the whole scrum team.

**Daily scrum** - is a short daily meeting designed to let the team plan out its work for the day and identify any 
obstacles that could impact that work. Most teams hold these meetings in the morning and limit them to 10 or 15 minutes.

**Sprint review** - In a Sprint Review meeting, the Scrum Team and stakeholders discuss the work done during the Sprint. 
The group then collaborates on what steps should be taken next to optimize the value of the software

**Sprint retrospective** - The sprint retrospective is a recurring meeting held at the end of a sprint used to discuss 
what went well during the previous sprint cycle and what can be improved for the next sprint. The Agile sprint 
retrospective is an essential part of the Scrum framework for developing, delivering, and managing complex projects.


***SCRUM ROLES***

**ScrumMaster** - Scrum masters serve as facilitators for agile teams working under the scrum methodology. They're the 
point person responsible for understanding the big development picture of each sprint. They bridge the needs of product 
management, sales, marketing, operations, and product development.

**Product Owner** - The product owner's responsibility is to create the list of backlog items and prioritize them based 
on the overall strategy and business objectives. Additionally, the product owner will need to map out project 
dependencies to inform the necessary sequence of development.

**Development Team** - It is the team that is responsible for building the actual product increment and meeting the 
sprint goal.



**Question 2**

one person can work on login/authorisation  page (parallel)
one person can work on a cancellation/edit booking page (this could potentially be dependent on the login/authorisation 
page as the customer might need to put in their login details to cancel/edit their bookings)
one person work on database management (parallel)
one person can work on database backup
one person work on a change password/ forgotten password page (parallel)
one person can work on debugging/troubleshooting (this would be done only after the code is 
written)
one person can work on payment page (parallel)
one person can work on API (connects to the database)
one person can work on security/ hacking prevention 



**TASK 2 (SQL)**

Draw a list of key requirements
1) location - to show cinemas close by 
2) pricing of different movies for different ages and different screens(2D/3D etc)
3) timer - if booking isn't confirmed after 10 minutes should cancel and go back to main page
4) information - about movies and also times of screening and number of seats remaining 
5) payment - card details (should be able to save details), discount codes, membership card code 
6) cancel or edit bookings 
7) animated images of the screens to show potential seat placements 
8) play trailers for movies 
9) unique codes for each booking 
10) log in/ authorisation 

What are your main considerations? 
booking should be quick, easy to navigate (especially for first time customers)
The system also needs to be able to withstand high traffic which might occur on days with new big movie releases 

What would be your common or biggest problems? - confirming age could be a big concern some movies have an age 
requirement and if they are booking on the web or on an app, how could we confirm age. 

What components or tools would you potentially use?
potentially link to the phone camera so that people could scan ID for age confirmation 
map tool to show the route to the closest cinema
